ClassIX simplifies gaming history by bundling six generations of consoles into one convenient emulation pack. No need to search endlessly for ROMs and emulators—everything from NES and Genesis to PS2 is included for a seamless gaming experience. Unlike Retroarch, ClassIX is simply a large file with mulitple folders. No need for an installation of anything. Simple if you just want everything you need, straight to the point.

⚠️ **CLASSIX IS AROUND 50GB DUE TO THE MANY ROMS AND EMULATORS! BASICX IS MUCH SMALLER!** ⚠️

# Advantages:
**All-in-One Solution:** Access six generations of consoles in a single pack, eliminating the need for multiple downloads and installations.

**Saves Time and Effort:** Say goodbye to the hassle of hunting down individual ROMs and emulators. ClassIX provides a comprehensive collection in one place.

# Why not Retroarch?
While Retroarch is very good for the majority of people, ClassIX includes ROMS, is even simpler to use, and includes guides built in. Just straight to the point, no need to launch a application for your games. Just open the emulator, and your basically done.
